			<p>
				My name is Zeynep Nur Genel, and I'm 19 years old. I graduated from Izmir Bornova Anadolu Lisesi. I'm currently in my first semester studying Computer Engineering at ITU. I am originally from Izmir but now that I study in Istanbul, I am staying in the dormitories at ITU's Ayazağa Campus. In my leisure time, I enjoy watching TV shows and reading young adult and sci-fi novels. I played Ultimate Frisbee in high school so when I came to ITU I joined ITU’s frisbee team “Frizbi Teknik”.

				I am interested in designing things, including websites. Last year, I made sticker for a student club. Now, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create websites. Besides these, I want to improve myself in backend development to create new projects. I'm also interested in computational neuroscience. I want to work in a lab environment doing researches in this field. After gaining some experience and increasing my knowledge, I would like to work in international companies, in the future.
